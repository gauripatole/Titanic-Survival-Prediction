# Titanic-Survival-Prediction

Implement a single-neuron neural network, specifically the logistic regression unit.
Replace the sigmoid activation function with an alternative, such as ReLU and tan.
Utilize the Log Loss Function for the optimization process.
Code the stochastic gradient descent (SGD) algorithm for optimization.
Organize the implementation as a set of functions.
Perform a classification task using the Titanic dataset.
Evaluate the model's performance by calculating accuracy and F1 score as the final step

Conclusion:
The Titanic dataset is a binary classification problem used to predict passenger survival based on characteristics like age, gender, and ticket class.
A single neural network model can be employed to make predictions with the Titanic dataset.
The neural network's weights reveal the most crucial features for predicting survival, such as higher ticket class and being female.
Unlike linear models, neural networks can learn non-linear relationships between features and the target variable.
Overfitting can occur if the neural network is trained for too long or with excessive complexity, leading to poor performance on new data.
Comparing the model's performance on training and validation sets helps detect overfitting.
A well-trained neural network can adapt well to slightly different data distributions, showcasing its generalization capabilities.
Although neural networks provide insights into feature-target relationships, they can be prone to overfitting and produce complex results that are not easily interpretable.
